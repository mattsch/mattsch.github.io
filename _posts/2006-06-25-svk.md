Came across <a href="http://svk.elixus.org" title="SVK">SVK</a> while looking for a way to mirror my subversion repos between this new server and my home network.  According to their site, SVK "supports repository mirroring, disconnected operation, history-sensitive merging, and integrates with other version control systems, as well as popular visual merge tools".  It's based on <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>, has some damn promising features....
