Got this blog all updated with the <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">new 1.5 version</a>, had no issues...  For those that wanna do the same, there's a nice walk-thru on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrade_1.2_to_1.5">wiki</a>.

I also changed my theme a bit, dunno if I really like it but it's a change and I was pretty bored with the old one...  I got it from <a href="http://www.thoughtmechanics.com/blog/">thought.mechanics</a> where dude has quite a few nifty themes for 1.5.

<strong>Edit:</strong>
I've already changed to this <a href="http://www.fuegodesigns.com/blog/white/">Red & Blue Make White</a> theme, and will prolly change more over the next few days...
