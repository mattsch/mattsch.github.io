Good ole' Hollywood is screwing everyone again.  The FCC approved a "broadcast
flag" too effectively take away the option of recording anything on TV.
According to [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk), ["...any device
capable of receiving digital TV transmissions must have the feature...by July 1
2005"](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/54/33807.html).  Forget recording
educational shows so your kids can watch em at a more convient time, or that
oh-so-cool time shift feature of PVR's.

The people in charge of these multi-billion dollar entertainment industries have
turned into complete idiots.  Instead of attempting to limit the recording of
shows, the cable industry should be developing their on-demand offerings.
Trying to fight the online sharing of shows is a loosing battle.  One that will
sap funds and is ultimately pointless.

Ah well...  I'm betting that within the first month this technology is in place
someone will come up with a way to get around it.  Then get thrown in jail for
violating the DMCA.
