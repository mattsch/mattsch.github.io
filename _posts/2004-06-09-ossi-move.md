We (<a href="http://www.oss-institute.org" target="_parent">OSSI</a>) finally got moved into our new building yesterday...  Had to do the usual fight with Comcast to get a working internet connection, plus I'm still tracking down all the network drops in our offices.  Apparently Comcast has moved from simply having the tech that does the install call in the MAC address of the cable modem to a Windoze 'install wizard', but that's a rant for another day...  ;)

The new office space is seriously nice... Lots of space for all us "UberGeeks" to spread out and work.  We should also be building a nice cluster next week.  That should be lots of fun to play with and provide us a way to do our own customized distro.  We are also planning on putting the whole <a href="http://openmosix.sourceforge.net/" target="_parent">OpenMosix</a> vs. <a href="http://distcc.samba.org/" target="_parent">Distcc</a> debate to rest with some good benchmarks.
