Tom Adelstein (heading up the Leopard project) has an [interesting
interview](http://www.desktoplinux.com/articles/AT9683428306.html) titled "Linux
from the trenches: A frank analysis of Linux as it moves toward critical mass"
on DesktopLinux.com.  I kinda get mentioned indirectly as the "developers" part
of the "talented developers" working on Leopard.

USM also gets an indirect mention as the "major University" looking into
OpenOffice adoption.  That meeting was a real bummer once it became obvious that
a forced migration would just be unreasonable.  People are just too damn scared
of change to try something new.

All in all it's a good read, and I highly recommend it....  ;)
