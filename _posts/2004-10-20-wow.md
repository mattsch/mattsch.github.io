Came across <a href="http://inpastelsonly.net/">this site</a> today looking for some graphics to "borrow" to replace this non-inspiring header and discovered a rarity; Smart, Female, Attractive, *nix Geek.  I always thought this was an urban legend (think Yeti, but different, in a good way), but I sifted thru her <a href="http://damn-laws.net/subpages/index.php?">personal site</a> a bit and she's the real deal...

There's some really good <a href="http://damn-laws.net/subpages/tutorials.php">PHP and CSS tutorials</a> on her site, and there's some honest talent at work there... 

I wonder how much she would charge for a header graphic...
