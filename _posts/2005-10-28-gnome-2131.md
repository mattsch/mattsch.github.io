For those living under a rock, <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/devel-announce-list/2005-October/msg00003.html">Gnome 2.13.1</a> has been released and I'm working on getting it into the  <a href="http://www.breakmygentoo.net">BMG</a> overlay.  So far I haven't noticed any real breakage, however the new version of libgsf does require a quick revdep-rebuild as it changes .so naming.  I hope to have it all committed by this evening, but there's been quite a few issues I've found requiring patches so it's been slow going...

<strong>edit:</strong>
Gnome 2.13.1 is officially in our tree...   I added a 'gnome-firefox' USE flag to the metabuild for those that don't want/like/need <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/">Epiphany</a> and would rather use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> as their default.

As usual, if you have any issues <strong>do not</strong> report em to the official Gentoo bugzilla or upstream.  They should all be reported to our <a href="https://bugs.breakmygentoo.net/">bug tracker</a> so we can track down the source...
