**Rant Alert!**

F*ck Yahoo's messenger service!  I am soo damn tired of dealing with all of
these propietary chat services and their complete waste of time and resources
trying to keep people off em that don't use their software.  It's just chat
people, not some lucrative commercial secret.  They've already lost their edge
with [jabber](http://www.jabber.org) in the mix, so they should be
concentrating on improving interoperabilty (whew!) instead of locking folks
out.

If anyone wants to get in touch with me via im, I'm
lin_matt@jabber.org on Jabber.
