I've just installed the new <a href="http://gnome.org">Gnome</a> beta release (<a href="http://www.gnome.org/~davyd/gnome-2-12/">overview</a>, <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/devel-announce-list/2005-July/msg00004.html">announcement</a>) and am thrilled with the feature improvements so far.  I know it's a beta release, but it's been stable and haven't found much of any breakage... yet... ;)

I couldn't get evolution to compile and run, but I've chatted with a few folks and apparently there's some serious IMAP bugs still to be ironed out so and it's considered pretty unstable by the devs, so I would avoid it unless you are looking to do some serious work.  Also, after installing the new glib/cairo/gtk+ combo make sure to compile new Mozilla/Firefox <em>without</em> the `mozsvg` USE flag or it will segfault on startup.  There's also been some changes on the libwnck front (<a href="http://bugs.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128380">Gnome bug #128380</a>) that led me to use CVS and recompile gnome-panel.

The new Nautilus "spatial tree view" is ok, but I dunno if it's really an improvement from a usability standpoint.  The new browse view with the tree sidebar however is an absolutely wonderful thing.  I've also finally switched over to using <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/totem/">Totem</a> with the <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">Gstreamer</a> backend which works wonderfully along with the <a href="http://ronald.bitfreak.net/pitfdll.php">pitfdll</a> plugin to pretty much play everything I was able with the Xine backend.

Since I've pretty much laid <a href="http://breakmygentoo.net">BreakMyGentoo</a> to rest, I've been able to actually use someone else's overlays to install for a change which has been quite nice.  For those that are looking, I used <a href="http://www.steev.net/?p=59">Steev's</a> overlay with very few issues, but there's also one from <a href="http://raphael.slinckx.net/blog/index.php/2005-08-01/beta-packages-summer-of-code">kikidonk</a> that looks good.

**[edit]:**
Found a few issues and patches...  The first is Gnome <a href="http://bugs.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128380">#128380</a> (<a href="/files/libwnck-2.11.4-revert_activate.patch">patch</a>), the second is kinda introduced by the first and is <a href="http://bugs.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=311819">#311819</a> (<a href="/files/metacity-2.11.1-remove_spew.patch">patch</a>)
