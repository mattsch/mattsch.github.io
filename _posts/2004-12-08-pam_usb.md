Got pam_usb up n running again on my laptop...  It was as simple as "emerge pam_usb" and adding a sufficient line to /etc/pam.d/system-auth.  Now if the author could get the <a href="http://pamusb.org">site</a> back up again...

<strong>Edit:</strong>
Welcome back Andrea!  Glad to see the site is back up, and I hope this means development will continue as well.  Integration with pam_mount would be pretty damn sweet...  ;)
