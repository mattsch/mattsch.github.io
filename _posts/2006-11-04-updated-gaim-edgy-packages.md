I upgraded the <a title="Gaim Messenger" href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net">Gaim</a> packages in my Edgy <a title="Ubuntu Edgy Repo" href="http://www.excentral.org/ubuntu/edgy/">repo</a> to the latest (beta 4) release today.  Because I stupidly didn't sync with the upstream Ubuntu packages, you'll have to remove the gaim-otr plugin and re-install.   The plugins I have are gaim-otr, gaim-encryption and gaim-libnotify.  I'm prolly gonna go ahead and do a quick <a title="Hig-ified xchat" href="http://xchat-gnome.navi.cx/">Xchat-gnome</a> package cause the new version has a few sweet features like themable icons and irc command tab completion.

<em>Note: I've removed all the launchpad and automatic bug reporting patches from all my packages.  I don't want any spurious bug reports going upstream to the Ubuntu folks.
