Got the new development version of Evolution in the <a href="http://www.breakmygentoo.net/">BMG</a> tree today, so I figured I might as well post some of the changes I've found so far...

The biggie is the new <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~notzed/doc/e-plugin-manual/">plugin</a> architecture, which will allow for features to be added/removed by the end user (yay!).  There's a <a href="http://www.excentral.org/Screenshot-1.png">Plugin Manager</a> UI so you can select which plugins you want to use, and the default list is pretty impressive IMHO.  My personal favorite is the <a href="http://www.excentral.org/Screenshot.png">"Audio inline plugin"</a> which allows for previewing tunes from within Evo.

You can also setup Evo to automagically add folks your address book from Gaim as well as any emails you reply to (<a href="http://www.excentral.org/Screenshot-2.png">snap!</a>).

Even tho this is a development release, it's noticeably faster and has yet to crash on me...
