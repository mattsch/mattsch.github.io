Been moving stuff around to free up what was my office here at the house to be used as a nursery for the past week and a half, which has involved switching rooms with Britton.  It's truly amazing to see just how much stuff a 7 yr old is capable of accumulating yet never gets touched.  She's been complaining about the room shuffle since she no longer has the biggest bedroom and has had to "sacrifice" a good many of the toys that she never touches...

Since I have this laptop from OSSI, I've given up and moved what had been my office machine over to our bedroom.  In the process of the move, I discovered that the hard drive was dying so I had to replace that one.  Didn't really feel like going thru all the fun of a <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> install (sorry guys), so I dropped <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Unbuntu</a> on there.  I have had a few issues getting it to fit into my openldap auth setup, but I think I've got all that sorted out now.

I've still got a ton of shite to go thru in the office/nursery so we can start on the painting in there, but I think I've gotten all the big stuff moved now so it's all downhill from here....
