For all the [BreakMyGentoo](http://breakmygentoo.net) devotees I'd like to
apologize for the complete lack of attention the site's been getting as of late.
Leopard's pretty much just squeezed everything else out of the equation.  I plan
on spending some quality time with the site this weekend getting bugs squashed,
ebuilds posted and BMG Gnome updated....
