I've done a small script to parse the xml feed from <a href="http://www.shoutcast.com">Shoutcast.com</a> .  I'll be using this as the base for a new and improved (hopefully) 'Web Radio' plugin for <a href="http://freevo.sf.net">Freevo</a>.

BTW, whoever decided that people should be able to pull genres out of their ass for a Shoutcast feed should be shot...
