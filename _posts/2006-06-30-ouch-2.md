As a recent survivor of raid crashes, I read the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/06/29/couchsurfing-deletes-itself-shuts-down/" title="Techcrunch">TechCrunch</a> article about CouchSurfing's demise with great sympathy.  However, a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/06/29/couchsurfing-deletes-itself-shuts-down/#comment-88426">comment</a> from someone calling themselves "theone3" was just priceless.  Quoting here so I don't loose it:

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
Thereâ€™s not half the files there used to be,
And thereâ€™s a milestone hanging over me
The system crashed so suddenly.

I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.
Now all my dataâ€™s gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
Need for backup seemed so far away.
Seemed my data were all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
