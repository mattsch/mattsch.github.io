This has been a very, very fruitful day out here.  All 250+ Leopard CD's and our
promotional lit within the first 90 minutes of the exhibit floor opening this
morning.  We made lots of contacts, gave out a ton of cards and even had a few
run-ins with folks from the Dark Side ;).

Looks like we may be heading over to
[ApacheCon](http://apachecon.com/2003/US/index.html) this evening for a
little while to rub elbows with those folks.  Or maybe we will just head back
over to Coyote Ugly....

More to come...
