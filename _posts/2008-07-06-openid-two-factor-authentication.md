So, went looking around last night at the various <a href="http://openid.net/">Openid</a> options and came across <a href="https://pip.verisignlabs.com/">Verisign's PIP</a> service.  I rather liked the idea of using Verisign anyway simply due to their position as a well established security/identity provider.  Then I came across <a href="http://systembash.com/content/using-the-paypal-verisign-security-key-with-openid-for-two-factor-authentication/">this post</a> detailing the available two-factor authentication and I was sold.  I won't go into the gory details, but suffice to say I've got my key on order.

Oh, and I've got this blog now fully Openid-ized so you can use your id to leave comments.
