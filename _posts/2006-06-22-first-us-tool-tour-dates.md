<a title="Toolshed" href="http://toolshed.down.net/tour/">Toolshed</a> has an updated listing of the tour dates.  According to <a href="http://www.livedaily.com/news/Additional_tour_dates_surface_for_Tool-3503.html">liveDaily</a>, they'll be playing a show at New Orleans' <a href="http://www.voodoomusicfest.com/2006/home.php">Voodoo Music Experience</a> alongside Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Duran Duran.  I might actually have to fly out for that one...

Looks like we'll see the tour dates continue to trickle out over the coming weeks, with all dates expected by the middle of July.  They gotta have one at the RBC Center.  Right?
