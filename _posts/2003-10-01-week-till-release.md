Yup...  One week from today we will be releasing the core Leopard environment.
I hope.  I'm not really worried about making the deadline, but I gotta say this
whole thing has been a bit of a wild ride for me and the release announcements
going out increase the pressure just a bit...

Karl's pretty much out for this release, but we still have Tim and Meethune on
the install scripting.  Jake's doing what he can to keep things rolling and Tom
T. is finally back online so the PHPWebsite module should start rolling pretty
soon.

This should be a fun week...

**Whee!**
