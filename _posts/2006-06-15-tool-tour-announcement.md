According to <a title="Announcement imminent?" href="http://www.fourtheye.net/?p=392">Fourth Eye</a>, <a title="Tool tour dates" href="http://www.toolband.com/tour/">Tool</a> is gonna be making a "huge announcement" on Monday.  Here's hoping it's the much anticipated US tour dates!

Those dates <strong>better</strong> include Raleigh.
BTW, if you haven't bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=excentral-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB000EULJLU%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1150423268%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8">10,000 Days</a> yet, you are really missing out...
