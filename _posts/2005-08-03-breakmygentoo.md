Well, ownership of <a href="http://www.breakmygentoo.net">BreakMyGentoo</a> has officially been turned over to Lars Strojny (mastaYoda) and he's certainly taken off with it.  I'll prolly still be involved with the site on some level, but nothing like I have been for the last few years.

Best of luck Lars!
