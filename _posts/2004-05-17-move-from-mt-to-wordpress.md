After <a href='http://movabletype.org/' target='_parent'>Movable Type's</a> move to their new <a href='http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/05/its_about_time.shtml' target='_parent'>licensing scheme</a>, I've decided to move to <a href='http://wordpress.org/' target='_parent'>WordPress</a>.  I'll also be looking at moving all sites I'm running over as I have time...

WordPress doesn't offer quite the feature set that MT does, but it's in very active development, PHP and (most importantly) GPL'd.  Viva Free (speech) Software!
