The Gaim folks got Yah** working and have [release
0.70](http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ChangeLog).  From the
[announcement](http://gaim.sf.net) it looks like this is gonna be a
moving target so god only knows how long it will work...  Which brings me back
around to Jabber.

I messed around with the jabberd server over the weekend and was able to get it
fully functional (directory, registration) in less than an hour including
tweaks!  It also support SSL connections natively so you have encrypted chat.  I
haven't messed with any of the transports, and I doubt I will at this point.
I'm trying to move everyone I know over to Jabber at this point, but that's an
uphill battle.  Just glad Gaim consolidates everything for me...
