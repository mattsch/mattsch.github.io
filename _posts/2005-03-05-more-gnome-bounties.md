Ben Maurer has been allocated $3000 by Nat (from <a href="http://www.gnome.org/bounties/">Novell's GNOME Bounties</a>) to offer <a href="http://codeblogs.ximian.com/blogs/benm/archives/000457.html">bounties for memory reduction</a> in Gnome.  I think the amount of innovation amongst the Gnome devs has led to pushing for more features rather than optimization and hopefully with this announcement this will change.
