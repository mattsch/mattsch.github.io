According to the latest warnings, we are looking <a href="http://www.weather.com/weather/alerts/?alertId=42527&dbSeq=null" target="_parent">"WIND SPEEDS OF 75 TO 85 WITH PEAK GUSTS TO NEAR 100 MPH"</a> and <a href="http://www.weather.com/weather/alerts/?alertId=41867&dbSeq=null" target="_parent">flash flooding</a>...

Is it a bird? A plane? Or maybe a submarine?
