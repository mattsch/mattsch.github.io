Yup, I'm sheeple... ;)

Got my <a href="http://mugshot.org/">Mugshot</a> invite today and signed up.  It's got some potential, tho I dunno how much I'll use the <a href="http://mugshot.org/radar-learnmore">music radar</a> feature.  It's still a bit buggy, but it is beta so no shocker there.  Not entirely sold on it - haven't really used it much either....

Did get a notifiication bout a new feature (?companion site?) called "<a href="http://www.fanlete.com/">fanlete</a>" which will prolly be something I actually get into.  Looks like a more targeted branding of mugshot for sports fans.  Having recently moved, this could be a pretty fun way to still watch a game with old friends.  This plus my fantasy football habit could prove to be quite the sunday afternoon/monday night timekiller....

<strong>edit:</strong> To clarify, fanlete isn't from the mugshot folks... I gotta blog on more sleep ;)
