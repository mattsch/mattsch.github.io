Found a link to an article [in LinuxWorld] about [Bruce Perens]' newest
brainchild, [UserLinux].  In his [white paper], Bruce makes a pretty convicing
case for a new structure in the Linux business world being built almost entirely
around the service model.  In short, his plan would call for a central
non-profit center funded by a consortium of "companies that are in the buiness
of providing service and engineering for the UserLinux distribution".  His
proposal also includes basing this new distro on [Debian] because of it's
already immense (12884) number of official packages, the apt package management
system and it's rapidly maturing enterprise features.

This seems to be one of the better **ideas** I've seen in a while for the
continued evolution of Linux and OSS in general, tho I do see a potentially
large pothole.  What happens when one of the big commercial partners decides to
take their ball and go home for whatever reason, and what mechanism would be in
place to insure equality in the services provided by the non-profit to it's
contributing members?  For instance, if a Novell (contributing say $200,000) per
year decides it wants to take UnitedLinux in a particular direction and
threatens to reduce or even remove it's financial support.

On the other hand, the resulting central yet open framework for development
could provide some of the best advances in software (features, stability and
security) seen to date.  I think with some very careful planning in it's
infancy, this concept has a lot of great potential and is quite revolutionary in
it's view.
