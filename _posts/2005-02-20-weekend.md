Got to just mope around the house this weekend with Tiff since Britton decided to spend the weekend with the grandparents.  Been rather nice with the exception of phone calls every few hours to see if Tiff was in labor...

Watched <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0387564/">Saw</a> yesterday and was really impressed with the story and acting (mostly).  It had a few weak moments, but the ending had a great plot twist and it was overall very enjoyable.

This coming week should be very interesting considering I'll be involved with the interview process for my boss, gotta get a replacement power supply and switch ordered as well as trying to get a fresh lab image wrapped up and installed.  And that's all just at the CS dept.  :(
