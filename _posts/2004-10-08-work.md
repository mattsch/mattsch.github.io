Let's see here...  I just wrapped up getting everything together for the accreditation board's visit to <a href="http://www.usm.edu/css/" target="_parent">the department</a> which wasn't really a big deal, just a bit of a headache trying to get certain lazy-*ss folks to do their part.  Had to get three machines running for the board to use while they are here, course I made sure that <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/index.html" target="_parent">Firefox</a> replaced IE as the default brower...  One oddity tho, the board requested a copy of Wordperfect be installed on one of the machines.  I haven't really seen or heard of anyone messing with it in years.

Things at <a href="http://www.oss-institute.org/" target="_parent">OSSI</a> are really gearing up with some pretty exciting projects coming our way.  I can't say much in detail yet, but we are gonna be working with <a href="https://www.navo.navy.mil/" target="_parent">NAVOCEANO</a> and a Linux distribution on a really big project.  And by big project I mean potential industry impact and the project's scope (NAVO guideline doc is <b>huge</b>).
