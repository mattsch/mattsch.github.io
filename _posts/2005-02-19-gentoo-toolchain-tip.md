Came across the following suggestion for the best way of handling updates for
your base [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org) toolchain to maximize your
system's stability.  For those that don't know, your toolchain is the core
system libraries and compiler (glibc, gcc, binutils, etc.).  Even minor version
bumps and patch updates can change the way your binaries are built so you owe it
to yourself to re-emerge the system to keep things running smoothly, especially
if you are using the unstable ('~' keyworded) branch of gcc/glibc.

Simply run `emerge system && emerge system && emerge world` and enjoy.
