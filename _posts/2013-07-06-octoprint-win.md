Just to follow up my <a href="http://www.excentral.org/archives/2013/07/05/wi-fi-3d-printer-prep">previous post</a>, my Raspberry Pi OctoPrint setup worked entirely as advertised.  I expected tweaks and problems, but the stack Just Worked and we were able to concentrate on tweaking the various temperature/calibration settings for the printer instead and managed to get some damn good prints for our first real trial.  I uploaded timelapse videos generated from OctoPrint to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf-uR2dkNrfzWmmnldQBzUo4oAyAPNZ2z">YouTube</a> for reference.
