Came across this earlier... Looks like a promising project using <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">GStreamer</a> for the conversion process.  Only supports converting to <a href="http://www.theora.org/">Theora</a> ATM, but other formats are planned...

<a href="http://thoggen.net/">thoggen - DVD backup/ripping with style</a>
