I've been trying out several plugins and figured a little summary of the ones I've found useful was in order.

<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://unknowngenius.com/wp-plugins/">WP Plugin Manager</a></strong> - One-Click Install and a ton of plugin listings.  This one rocks!</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://firasd.org/studio/wp/wp-cc">WP CC</a></strong> - Makes managing your <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licensing easy.  You <em>do</em> have a CC license for your content, don't you?</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.coldforged.org/spelling-checker-plugin-for-wordpress/">Spelling Checker</a></strong> - Spell checks your posts before you publish using <a href="http://aspell.sourceforge.net/">aspell</a></li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma">Spam Karma</a></strong> - Aptly called the "Ultimate Spam Fighting Tool" by it's author, this is a must-have these days with all the various types of <a href="http://www.blogspam.org/">blog spam</a> floating around.  There's a detailed guide to the options <a href="http://www.jonabad.com/spamkarma/sk_doc.html">here</a></li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/BunnysTechnoratiTags">Bunny's Technorati Tags</a></strong> - If you use <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> and haven't discovered their new <a href="http://www.technorati.com/help/tags.html">tags</a>, you should check it out.  This plugin adds a custom "tags" field to each post and appends em to the post.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://asymptomatic.net/wp-hacks">BAStats</a></strong> - Stats collector, don't know if I'll use this long term, but still quite useful</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/favatars">Favatars</a></strong> - Downloads favicon for URLs posted on comments.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.jamietalbot.com/wp-hacks/">X-Valid</a></strong> - "Attempts to create valid XHTML from arbitrary source".  In short, makes your posts and comments validate against a Doctype of your choice</li>

</ul>
