Well, I finally decided on a what is (IMHO) a really cool logo for the site.  I modified an <a href="http://icl.pku.edu.cn/yujs/MathWorld/math/e/e374.htm">excentral triangle</a> (using <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The Gimp</a>), added a bit of color and voila!  Ironically enough, it came out looking much like an odd stick man with detached legs, but I suppose that fits as well...

There's also now a favicon I was able to generate from a transparent <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/">PNG</a> at a really slick <a href="http://www.chami.com/html-kit/services/favicon/">site</a>.
