I've been pretty damn tardy with my updates as of late, but things have been very hectic.

On the <a href="http://www.oss-institute.org" target="_parent">OSSI</a> side, John just got back from <a href="http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/live/12/events/12SFO04A" target="_parent">LWE</a> and has scared us up some more members (corporate and associate) which should provide more opportunities and funding.

Been very busy with various projects with the <a href="http://spg.oss-institute.org" target="_parent">SPG</a> with the latest being a really slick, low-cost NAS approach.

Britton started back to school this week.  She's now in the second grade and will be starting her REACH studies next week...  She amazes me every day with her intelligence both with her studies and people.

Tiff is doing well...  She's hit the 12 week mark in the pregnancy which means she's mostly past the morning sickness phase.  Course now all the weird pregger food cravings are starting to kick in, but at least she can eat without getting sick.
