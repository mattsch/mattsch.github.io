Did a bit of digging a few weeks ago and came across <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=8ca2e8914b913dd30a7800d9706aecf5217224ec">Linode</a> VPS.  With better prices than Slicehost, data centers both here in the US as well as the UK and excellent reviews I ended up giving it a spin and eventually moving wholesale.  Performance is much better with the new hosting, was able to set up a fully customized OS install (SELinux, encrypted fs) and then duplicate that image over from my primary ATL vm to my secondary in the UK.  Yea, I've now got a fully distributed setup complete with a hot spare on a different continent (better than most ecommerce sites on the web today) for less than the price of my single Slice. 

With a really nice management console and solid (so far) service, this is pretty much the best option I've seen in the VPS hosting space.  I'd highly recommend it for anyone with a more technical background looking for a full-featured Xen host.
