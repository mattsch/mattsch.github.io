Just got this release emerged and I gotta say...  Just not impressed here.

First of all, there's just too many programs in these tarballs.  It takes
forever to compile and, tho the level of integration is cool to a certain
degree, there's just too damn much here.  I guess they figure that the software
splitting should be left up to the distro packagers but I disagree.

Second, all the kde programs that dock in the systray don't use the
Freedesktop.org specs.  This means I can't use a KDE application outside of KDE
and expect it to fully work.  **Shame!**

Third, I love HIG.  Users shouldn't have to wade thru acres of configuration
options to make their DE work intuitively.  This is one place that GNOME really
shines.  IMHO, after a DE is installed it should Just Work.
