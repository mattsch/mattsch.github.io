Took a little break from the fun of [leopard](http://leopard.sf.net) development
to check a few things out I've been meaning to for a while.

First of all, if you are a fan of Cowboy Bebop you ***must*** see the
[movie](http://imdb.com/title/tt0275277/).  I got hooked on the series thanks to
Cartoon Network and have been trying to check the movie out, but was afraid the
movie just wouldn't live up.  Man was I wrong!  The quality of the animation is
truely wonderful, plot is right on target (tho parts seemed a bit "updated" re:
9/11) and the script kept the feel from the series perfectly.  IMHO, this is a
must-see for anime fans and the casual observer alike.

While I was enjoying the movie, I had [giFT](http://gift.sourceforge.net) busy
compiling.  It's been quite a while since I checked out this project and it's
getting quite mature.  I was able to get it running with a minimum of effort and
was hooked up to openFT, FastTrack and Gnutella quite painlessly.  Great job
guys!

Ahh...  back to leopard...
