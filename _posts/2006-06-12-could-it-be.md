The <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> dev community is finally starting to <a href="http://http://blog.simplychristel.net/index.php?/archives/19-GWN,-Clarifications-and-Loss..html">reconsider</a> the leadership (or lack thereof) structure that's killing it?

It's sad really.  A wonderful concept and still my overall favorite distro.  However, I've been using it less and less due to lack of real QA, bug reports that shrivel and die on the vine and the difficulty (sometimes) of dealing with devs.  Kinda like Debian...

Here's hoping they can make changes before it becomes irrelevant...
