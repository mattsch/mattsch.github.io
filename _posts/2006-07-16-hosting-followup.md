Just a note for those considering VPS hosting, I hit my one month anniversary with <a href="http://affiliates.vpsland.com/idevaffiliate.php?id=138">VPSLand</a> and couldn't be happier.  I had an issue within the first week with a few random reboots, however their staff was on top of things and moved my host to a new box after the second time it happend.

Dealing with their billing staff on getting an upgrade was a bit of a prolonged process which rather suprised me.  Seems like they'd be a bit quicker to take more money from me, but that got sorted out in an acceptable amount of time.

YMMV, but so far things are quite peachy...
