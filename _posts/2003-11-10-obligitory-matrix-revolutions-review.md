**IT SUCKS**

I can't really say anything different than what's already been posted out there,
but all-in-all this last installment was a complete disappointment.  The dialog
tries too hard to be philosophical and the overall plot is very, very weak.

The only good thing about the movie was the final action sequence between Smith
and Neo.  Quite impressive, but certainly not worth the price of admission to
see it.

Wait till this comes out on DVD and rent it.
