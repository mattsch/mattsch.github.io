Sat up last night with the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Validator</a> and got the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML</a> produced from this theme all fixed.  I also ran the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">style sheet</a> thru and it passed as well, so you are now reading a fully compliant blog... Exciting isn't it? ;)
