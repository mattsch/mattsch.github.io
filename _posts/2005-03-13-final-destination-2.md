  <p>Caught most of this one on one of the movie channels over the past week and was rather impressed with the lengths the writers went to in killing off the actors.  Can't really say the  plot or acting was more than second rate and the pace of the movie was quite uneven, but it's not half bad for what it is.</p></div>
