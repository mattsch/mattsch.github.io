Back in the saddle again with Leopard now that all the USM/Newport stuff is
stablized...  I finally got the task list done for the module/package management
end of things.  Sent it out to the list along with a slight rant about folks on
the project that seem to only be along to ride on coattails.  Politics has never
been my strongest point...

Rhino joined the team and has brought all sorts of really great information for
the OGIP.  He's suggested using [Relax-ng] to validate the data as it's
recieved.  The data would still use [Z39.50] as the metadata layer, but Relax-ng
would add a layer of validation to the mix...

He also came across the W3C's [Web Services Architecture] and [Web Services
Architecture Requirements] papers.  Not exactly the most interesting read, but
perfect standards to know and follow for Leopard/OGIP apps....
