Having a hell of a time actually getting any work done on <a href="http://spg.oss-institute.org/wiki/index.php/PMF">PMF</a> right now and I have no idea why.  It's a bit of a project true, but I've done bigger and not had any issues.  Max has been putting code down at a huge rate, and I seriously owe him, but I lack any real motivation to work on it.  Can't figure whether it's a higher than usual stress level, burn out or just too many irons in the fire...

Tonight I gotta do something on it.
