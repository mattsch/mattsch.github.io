Thank god this one is finally here...  Samba/Windoze has been giving me fits for
months now and I'm hoping this will ease that somewhat.  [Release
notes](http://samba.org/samba/whatsnew/samba-3.0.0.html) show
some really cool features that should make my work life a bit easier.  Guess I
know what I'll be doing this weekend...  ;)
