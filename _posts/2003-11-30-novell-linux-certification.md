After their aquisition of SuSE and Ximian, looks like Novell is going to have
their own [NCLE (Novell Certified Linux Engineer)
program!](http://www.novell.com/training/certinfo/cle/index.html).


Now I know there's been a <strong>lot</strong> of discussion around the Open
Source community about Novell's intentions, but I think this will bring a whole
new group of people to Linux in business. Remember folks, at one time Novell was
the best. They know how to market and produce quality products, and with the
addition of the SuSE and Ximian personel I can't see how they/we can loose.
