So my new tasty <a href="http://www.johnsoncreeksmokejuice.com/product_p/0051.htm">'juice'</a> came in today and I'm 100% hooked.  The flavor is worlds above the pre-filled carts I got with my <a href="http://www.dietsmokes.com/products/DSE901b-%7B47%7D4075-Black-Starter-Kit.html">901</a> and it's much, much smoother.

I haven't had a cigarette now since the evening of the 8th, and I haven't missed em in the least.  My chest has cleared up significantly already, my energy levels are up and I can take deep breaths without a 'catch' again.  Sure, I still have the nicotine monkey on my back, but losing the tar and other misc chemicals has been a huge win.   I've also been able to deal with the daily stresses of my job without the normal withdrawal issues, matter of fact it's been a bit easier since I can just reach over and take a puff during those long phone meetings.
