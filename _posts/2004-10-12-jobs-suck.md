Well the accreditation team finished up their sweep of the department and left this afternoon, but not before screwing me completely.  It seems that some of the students complained about some of the lab machines having issues and the lack of USB support on all of the machines.  So the damn team decided that two half-time support people couldn't be enough and strongly recommended having two full-timers instead.  This means that I will have to go back to working in the department full time and ditch everything I've been working on with OSSI.

Here's hoping John can pull enough strings to keep that from happening, otherwise I'm gonna be looking for another job very quickly.  Working as a Sys Admin for that department got old a loooong time ago, so without the freedom I've had it's pointless to continue.
