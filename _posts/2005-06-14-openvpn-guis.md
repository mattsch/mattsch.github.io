Discovered tonight that <a href="http://openvpn.net">OpenVPN</a> now has choices for <a href="http://openvpn.net/gui.html">GUI's</a>!  For those that might not now, OpenVPN is a true cross-platform GPL-2 (mostly) VPN client-server package.  I've been using it for quite a while now to provide secure access to my home wired network from my wireless net as well as when I'm on the road, and would highly recommend it to others as well...

The only issue I've had is the lack of an easy to use frontend for those less technically inclined, but with the addition of these GUI's I think those days are over.
