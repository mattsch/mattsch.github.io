Finally got setup on a proper hosting service I think I'll be able to live with for a while.  My requirements never seemed all that exotic, but I couldn't ever find anything I felt all that comfortable with.  Until now.

Thanks to <a title="Xen virtualization" href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/">Xen</a>, I now have a fully functional <acronym title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</acronym> running <a title="Ubuntu Dapper" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/news/606released">Dapper</a>.  I decided to try out <a title="VPSLand Plans" href="http://affiliates.vpsland.com/idevaffiliate.php?id=138">VPSLand</a> because they are cheap, and folks seemed to be pretty happy with em.

So far I'm quite happy with the level of service.  My one support request was taken care of promptly and correctly.  My server was setup just as advertised, but I am gonna move up from my current 96 MB plan to 192 MB.  I figured it wasn't gonna be enough, but I didn't wanna commit any more cash than I had to just to try it out...
