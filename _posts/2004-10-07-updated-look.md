I've finally found a good base template to work from.  It's called <a href="http://fernando.dubtribe.com/archives/2004/09/22/headspace-for-kubrick125-wp12/" target="_parent">Headspace</a> and it's based on the excellent <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/kubrick/" target="_parent">Kubrick</a> template.  There's quite a bit I want to do with this one (header graphic, css cleanups, etc) over the next few weeks, but I'm really digging this base.
