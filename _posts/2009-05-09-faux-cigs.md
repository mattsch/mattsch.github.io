So, been aware of the so-called '<a href="http://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/">eCig</a>' for a little while now but finally was able to try one a friend has at work.  My starter kit and a few extras came in yesterday evening and so far I'm impressed.  It's taking care of my cravings which is more than I can say about any of the other options I've tried, my lungs are already feeling better and I'm not 24 hrs into this experiment.  I think I'll actually try and update the status of this little experiment in case someone else out there is on the fence about it as well...
