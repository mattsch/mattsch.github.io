Just discovered something rather interesting.  If you are using <a href="http://www.technorati.com/help/tags.html">Technorati tags</a>, make sure your WP theme includes the rss links in the header.<code /> This will make sure any tags you've specified will get picked up by their bot and, as a nice bonus, will allow the "Live Bookmarks" auto-discovery to work right in <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>.

<strong>edit:</strong> moved the example to text file, inline gave me fits with xhtml
