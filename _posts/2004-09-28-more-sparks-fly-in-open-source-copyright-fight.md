You know, for what's supposed to be a "community" project, the <a href="http://www.mamboserver.com/">Mambo</a> folks sure are acting a fool.  I've seen all the communications between the two companies in this fight, and it's basically just one big cluster fsck...  The <a href="http://www.miro.com.au/">Miro</a> folks aren't willing to sit down and talk while <a href="http://www.literatigroup.com/versusmambo/">Furthermore</a> just seems to be in the middle of a money grab.

The issue is quite simple really.  Either the Mambo project is using copyrighted work-for-hire code or they aren't.  All this posturing has become quite obscene and is going to ruin all parties involved...
