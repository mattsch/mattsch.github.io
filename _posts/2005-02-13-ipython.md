I discovered <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/">IPython</a> this weekend and have been really pleasantly suprised.  It's got a quite extensive <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/manual/node1.html#SECTION00011000000000000000">feature list</a> and while I prolly won't use most of this, the <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/manual/node6.html#SECTION00062000000000000000">"magic commands"</a> and <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/manual/node6.html#SECTION000614000000000000000">auto quoting/parens</a> have made doing Python a joy...
