We got confirmation Yesterday from the doctors that a new little brilliant, cute, primo child will be coming into our home...  The due date is supposed to be February 14th, but I'm betting it will be closer to the end of the month...

Britton's IQ test came back as well... Her score was more than adequate (96th percentile) to get her into the gifted program at school and classify her as "Intellectually Gifted"...

Woot!
