Had my first workout post-cigarettes and wow... Being able to breathe again makes a huge difference in the quality of the exercise (duh!).  Was able to really push myself without feeling like I was going to pass out from lack of oxygen and (amazingly) felt quite good after I was done.

Been trying to become less of a couch potato for years now and I guess I underestimated the effects of cigs.  Really not very bright on my part eh...
