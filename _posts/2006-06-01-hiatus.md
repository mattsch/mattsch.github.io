hmmm... Last post was back in February, lot's changed since then.

For starters, we are now living in <a title="Google map of Cary" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Cary,+NC&ll=35.791389,-78.781389&spn=0.066558,0.167885&om=1">Cary, NC</a>.  Why you ask? Well, I got a job offer I couldn't refuse from <a title="Red Hat Corp Site" href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat </a>.  I'm working as the sole sysadmin for the release engineering team, but rapidly taking over more of the general engineering boxes (like <a title="Red Hat Buzilla" href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/">bugzilla</a>).  There's a ton of work to be done, and it's an unbelievably cool atmosphere. I've often pondered about what goes on behind the scenes at RH, and even scoffed at some of the decisions made over the years.  Now all of the sudden I'm right in the thing of things under that sometimes obscuring Fedora and I'm loving every minute of it.  It's also been the reason I've not kept things updated here recently... ;)

We moved in quite a hurry (approx. two weeks!) but we managed to get a <a title="Apartment Photos" href="http://www.excentral.org/photos/v/NewApt/">really nice</a> apt, or at least a huge step up from our place in the <a title="Google map of Hattiesburg, MS" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Hattiesburg,+MS&om=1">Burg</a>.  The move was a bit hectic, but we've fallen in love with this area.  So much to do, so many educational opportunities for the girls.  Housing is a bit high in Cary proper and it is a bit suburban for my tastes, but there's some really nice areas just a stone's throw from here.

One unfortunate consequence of everything has been my extended hiatus from BreakMyGentoo.  I really miss it and would like to think I'll be back in it sometime soon, but the reality is I just don't see that happening.  It's been fun, met some really great folks I still keep in touch with and learned a ton.  But it's time to move on.  For now... ;)

I'll be updating more over the short-term, have a ton of stories I need to put up before the details get cold.  I've also got a patch someone sent me for the shoutcast stuff to keep pace with some upstream changes.  I'll get that applied and updated soon as well.

I'm also looking for a good <a title="Xen Virtualization" href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/">Xen-based</a> <acronym title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</acronym> company to move this and a few other sites to.  Right now, <a title="RimuHosting" href="http://www.rimuhosting.com">RimuHosting</a> is looking pretty attractive but I'm open to all suggestions.
