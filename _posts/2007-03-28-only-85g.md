Brew/<a href="https://hosted.fedoraproject.org/projects/koji/">Koji</a>'s db is well over 100G, Bugzilla is ~11G so your <a href="http://www.year26.org/2007/03/28/request-tracker/">puny 8.5G</a> RT database fails to impress. :)

BTW, for the record, <a href="http://bestpractical.com/rt">Request Tracker</a> is a slow and confusing beast.  I'd _really_ like to put it out of my misery.
