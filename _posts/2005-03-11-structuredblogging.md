My Dashboard posts lead me to look at <a href="http://structuredblogging.org/wordpress/?page_id=3">StructuredBlogging</a> and I decided to go ahead and implement it here.  In short, it's a way to standardize blogging posts so search engines and feed aggregators can better classify what you are actually posting on.  For you Wordpress'rs out there, they have a really tight <a href="http://structuredblogging.org/wordpress/?page_id=8">plugin</a> you can see in action on my <a href="http://www.excentral.org/archives/2005/03/11/new-beck-cd-2/">Guero</a> review.

I think it's about time I restructured things here a bit on the categories front, so don't be suprised if things move around a bit...
