I've been a hardcore <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/">Epiphany</a> user since far pre-1.0, but
<a href="http://dbs.homeport.org/archives/000258.html">this review</a> changed that for me.  Up till now, I've been using <a href="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/">Liferea</a> for my RSS aggregating, but being able to have all that integrated into my brower automagically is soooo nice...

Plus <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> does have some really sweet features of it's own...
