Ivan is close, and it's really obvious... The sky is all cloudy and things are eerily quiet.  They are now calling for 50-70 mph winds here tomorrow, but it really all just depends on where the damn thing hits land.

I've setup a gallery and added some 'before' pictures.  You can see it <a href="http://schick.mine.nu/gallery/Ivan" target="_parent">here</a>, and there's an rss feed <a href="http://schick.mine.nu/gallery/rss.php" target="_parent">here.</a>  This server is here at the house so I dunno if the power/cable will even last the night, but I'll be posting pics and news as long as I can.

ooooo... Just in from the <a href="http://weather.com" target="_parent">Weather Channel</a>, Ivan has turned due North putting Mobile directly in it's sights.
