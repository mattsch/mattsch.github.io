<a title="Listen to your blog" href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/richb?entry=listen_to_your_blog">Rich Burridge</a> posted an article bout using <a title="Letting blogs speak for themselves" href="http://www.talkr.com/9239/partners/">Talkr</a> for automagical conversion of blog posts to podcasts.  It's very simple to setup, works pretty well (tho it has some problems with more technical terms).  Quick signup on the Talkr site, installed the <a title="Podcast plugin" href="http://rayz.notdesign.net/archives/2005/12/30/talkr-podcast-plugin/">Wordpress plugin</a>, did some minor editing of the plugin for full xhtml compliance and all seems to be working well.

And oh yea, the voice <em>is</em> rather, um, nice... ;)
