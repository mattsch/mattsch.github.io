Looks like Bryan is gonna give us the first <em>real</em> audio cd burning app for Gnome!  I've been testing <a href="http://www.coaster-burn.org/">Coaster</a> since day one and it's a really nice burning app, so I'm stoked that he's finally getting around to adding audio cd's as well...

Rock on Bryan!
