Made the move from Bind to <a href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/">djbdns</a> tonight and can't really see myself going back.  Hostname lookups are faster, zone data file format actually makes sense, and the configuration files have a very logical layout.  Gotta love DJB's programs...

The migration was relatively straight forward and the questions I did have were easily answered via <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>.  Here's the links I found helpful:
