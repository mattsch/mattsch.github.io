I've just made the switch away from <a href="http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/BunnysTechnoratiTags">Bunny's Technorati Tags</a> to <a href="http://vapourtrails.ca/wp-keywords">Jerome's Keywords</a> since it means much greater flexibility.  Just click on any of the 'Tagged as' entries to see what I mean... Course that tag search pages is very much a work in progress, but what else is new... ;)
