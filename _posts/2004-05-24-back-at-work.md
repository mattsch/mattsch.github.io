Had an absolutely wonderful vacation time at home this past week.  Tiff and I got to spend some very much needed time alone together and I got some really good play time in with Britton.

Course all good things must come to an end...  Now I'm here at my desk again wishing there was someone out there that wanted to pay me to be a Linux Geek fulltime.  From home.  Any takers?
