Fresh on the heels of the <a title="Open Technology Development Roadmap" href="http://trends.newsforge.com/trends/06/07/07/233257.shtml?tid=138&tid=136">OTD</a> win comes news that some really big players in the encryption field <a href="http://www.gcn.com/online/vol1_no1/41371-1.html">have killed</a> the Openssl FIPS-140 certification.  <span class="story">Those players stand to loose a ton of money (millions? billions?) if there's a viable Open Source alternative out there and I'm guessing there was more than a little bit of pressure.  And NIST folded.  Hopefully <a title="Open Source Software Institute" href="http://www.oss-institute.org">John</a> will be able to continue pushing and get the certification re-instated.

And people wonder why I'm so cynical.
