Well I moved hosting... Again...  <a title="VPSLand" href="http://support.vpsland.com/affiliates/idevaffiliate.php?id=138">VPSLand</a> is a decent VPS hosting option, but I was having issues with poor disk I/O performance and the plan just wasn't cutting it.  So now I'm using <a title="slicehost" href="http://www.slicehost.com/">slicehost</a>. I'm using their entry-level plan, but it comes with 256MB, 10GB storage and 100GB bandwidth for $20/mo.  Now this isn't a hosting company that provides a lot of hand holding, but they are a knowlegeable bunch with a really nice setup.  Their management console allows you to do OS reloads, monitor your bandwidth and it has a really cool AJAX remote console.

Unlike VPSLand, slicehost doesn't provide secondary DNS services (yet) so I had to find another option.  Ended up going with <a title="Free DNS" href="http://www.everydns.net/">EveryDNS.net</a> since it's free (but donations are accepted).  They have four servers spread out over various countries, and it's damn fast.
