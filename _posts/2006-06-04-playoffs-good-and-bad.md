Bad is that the <a href="http://www.nba.com/suns/index_playoffs.html" title="Suns playoff site">Phoenix Suns</a> got bumped outta the NBA playoffs.  Soooo the finals will have two teams I simply don't care about - Dallas and Miami.

Good is that my new local hockey team (<a href="http://www.carolinahurricanes.com/" title="Carolina Hurricanes">Hurricanes</a>) are gonna be in the finals!  Never been much of a hockey fan, but watching the last game of the Eastern Conference finals was much more thrilling than I would have thought.  These guys play with lots of heart.  Go Canes!
