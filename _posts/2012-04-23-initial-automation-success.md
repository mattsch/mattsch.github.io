Got my various HA bits in this morning, was able to get the Vera Lite controller set up (dead easy) with my lamp plug and dimmer switch. All paired without issue and was able to set up a few rudimentary scenes to begin playing. The Vera web ui is well laid out, very straight forward and commands executed there are reflected almost instantly.

I'm using the Home Buddy beta app on my android devices <a href="http://forum.micasaverde.com/index.php/topic,9768.120.html">(link) </a> which works well. It does both spoken scene commands as well as allowing for control via Tasker (untested, but next on my list).
