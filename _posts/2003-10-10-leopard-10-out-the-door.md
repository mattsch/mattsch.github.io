Yup...  Finally got the beast uploaded to [the site](http://leopard.sf.net) late
Wednesday night.  Why the delay posting it here you ask?  The answer is twofold
actually.  To start, I pulled a few 22 hr days to get it whipped into shape for
the release so I've been spending as little time as possible in front of the
computer since.  Secondly, I've been waiting on John and Tom to get the press
releases done to do a complete blitz.  Now it looks like they are wanting to
wait till we get [Request Tracker](http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/)
installed/configured on a new server in Dallas.  At least we made our deadline.

I gotta say tho, Leopard has turned into quite a cool thing.  Meethune (who also
lost a lotta sleep to get this thing out) timed it on his laptop and it
installed in 3:42.  Pretty impressive since that's a full LAMP install with
absolutely **no** user input.
