For those that are tired of the "official" method of upgrading (backup, remove, re-install), Angsuman has <a href="http://blog.taragana.com/index.php/archive/wordpress-patch-upgrade-from-1512-to-1512-made-available/">posted a zip</a> of only the files changed in the 1.5.1.2 -> 1.5.1.3 security release.  I'm using it here and so far nothing has imploded.... ;)

Greate work Angsuman!
