Watched <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0390521/" target="_parent">Super Size Me</a> tonight while discussing <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/handbook/handbook.xml?part=2&chap=1" target="_parent">ebuild</a> conversion for <a href="http://spg.oss-institute.org/wiki/index.php/PMF" target="_parent">PMF/Bob/epac</a> with Meethune.  It was actually quite good, tho quite disturbing to see the actual damage done by fast food...

Accreditation meeting went quite well but there was some other drama around, but that's another story completely...
