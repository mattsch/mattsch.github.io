Haven't smoked a regular cig since Friday evening and I feel great.  Yesterday I did experience some restlessness but I'm chalking that up to the lack of the other chemicals in cigs.  It could also be as simple as learning to use the eCig...

Either way, I'm feeling much better today and zero withdrawl feelings.  So far so good.
