Finally went out and bought a proper family vehicle.  Did some research and the <a href="http://www.subaru.com/shop/overview.jsp?model=FORESTER&trim=25_X&command=overview">Subaru Forester</a> looked like the best fit.  It's got more than twice the cargo space of the ol Altima, awesome safety ratings, decent gas milage and reasonably priced.  And oh yea, it's pretty fun to drive... ;)

Pictures soon!
