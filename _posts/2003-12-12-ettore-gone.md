It seems the Gnome (and OSS) community has lost yet another champion.  Gnome
developer, Evolution leader and all around good guy [Ettore Perazzoli] passed
away the night of the tenth.  [Footnotes] is carrying the story along with many
links to the various Gnome dev's reactions.  First Chema, now Ettore....  :(
