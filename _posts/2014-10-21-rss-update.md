I've been using FeedBurner for so long I'd forgotten about it, not unlike Google who seems to be letting it die a slow death.  I've disabled my redirects and if you're following the feed you'll need to update your reader app to point <a href="http://www.excentral.org/feed">directly</a> to the site.  The FeedBurner url should continue to work for as long as Google keeps it around, but no real point in using it any longer.
