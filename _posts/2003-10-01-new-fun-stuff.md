[Openoffice 1.1.0](http://www.openoffice.org/about_us/1.1press_releaseb.html)
has been released, the
[Ximian-ized](http://www.ximian.com/products/desktop/features.html#openoffice)
source ebuilds are already on the
[forums](http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=92757) (which are
compiling quite happily) and I'll prolly get em posted on breakmygentoo shortly.
This release is really damn cool and I'll be getting it out on the lab machines
here on campus very quickly.  Maybe we can wean some of these folks away from
MS.

I've also been drooling over the [Gnome team's release
plans](http://www.gnome.org/start/2.5/) for 2.6 a bit seeing as 2.5.0 is due out
towards the
end of the month.  [GConf
re-write](http://lists.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2003-September/msg00826.html)
and the new [gtk+ file selector
api](http://lists.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2003-September/msg00015.html)
are the ones that really have my attention ATM, the new [spatial
model](http://lists.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2003-September/msg00446.html)
the nautilus team is working on seems like a step back to me tho.  I'm
gonna have to do a cvs checkout on it and see what I think before my final
judgement tho.
