The weather has certainly gotten worse, but it's not anything serious... Yet.

We've been watching <a href="http://schick.mine.nu/gallery/Wednesday/aaa" target="_parent">this tree</a> hoping when it breaks it will fall out into the cul-de-sac, however I feel pretty sure it's gonna take the power and cable with it when it goes...

Madden till the power goes out!
