I've changed back to the Bionic Jive template and added a few plugins to WP here including <a href="http://firasd.org/studio/wp/wp-cc">WP-CC</a> and <a href="http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/BunnysTechnoratiTags">TechnoratiTags</a>.  I haven't had the chance to configure the <a href="http://www.technorati.com/help/tags.html">tags</a> just yet, but I plan on it here shortly.

<strong>Edit:</strong>
Got the tags setup now as you can see.. Pretty cool actually.
