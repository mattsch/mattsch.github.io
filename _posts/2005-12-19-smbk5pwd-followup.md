I went ahead and hacked an ebuild to include the smbk5pwd overlay and submitted a <a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116045">bug</a> to the Gentoo bugzilla.  I don't know how well it will be received since it screws with the Kerberos dependancies, but we shall see...

If anyone wants a more direct download it's in my <a href="http://www.excentral.org/overlay/net-nds/">overlay</a>, but I'm not gonna drop it in BMG since it just doesn't seem appropriate...
