I came across [this press
release](http://www.cagw.org/site/PageServer?pagename=news_NewsRelease_09302003b)
linked from Slashdot.  Seems that "The Council for Citizens
Against Government Waste" has taken exception to Massachusetts mandating OSS
software for all state expenditures.  Now I'm not really a fan of barring anyone
from the marketplace, but I gotta make an exception when it's one of the most
rabidly anti-competitive corporations known to man.  Lemmie take a stab at a few
of the "points" in the press release.

*"People mistakenly refer to Linux as 'free' software because it can be freely
altered and distributed. Yet while the software itself is free, the cost to
maintain and upgrade it can become very expensive."*  Bullsh*t.  All the TCO
studies that have been done have shown that claim to be false.  Speaking as a
systems admin, I can automate just about every aspect of our linux boxen to the
point that I'm almost not needed on a day-to-day basis.  I've tried that with
the other os, and without paying $$$ for a specialized server I'm pretty much
sol.

*"It is ironic that Massachusetts, as the only state remaining in the lawsuit
accusing Microsoft of antitrust violations, is creating its own state-imposed
monopoly on software."*  I fail to see the monopoly here.  Anyone's software
is welcome, as long as it's licesensed in a free (as in speech) manner.  This
doesn't hurt the marketplace at all, and I'm betting that in our current economy
it will actually help.

There's more there, but it's the usual FUD and I've got work to do....
