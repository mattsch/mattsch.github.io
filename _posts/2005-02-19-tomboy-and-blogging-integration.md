It's occured to me that being able to post <a href="http://www.beatniksoftware.com/tomboy/">Tomboy</a> notes directly to a category on a blog would be a Good Thing.  I know there's also a push for evolution-data-server support to mark a note as a task or meeting, but I generally use it as a scratch space for current projects so e-d-s support wouldn't help.  However, having the blog option would allow me to have access to those notes from any web browser as well as potentially copying from the blog to Tomboy on another machine.

Anyone wanna take a shot at some patches? ;)
