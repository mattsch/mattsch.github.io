  <p>Watched this last night and enjoyed every minute of it.  The trailers I've seen portray it as just a comedy, but it's much more.  The fight scenes are way over the top with outrageous choreography, and the plot is mostly predictable but still quite entertaining.  I'm hoping to have the time to catch it in the theatres next week so I can see it on the big screen, but it's a DVD I will be purchasing very soon regardless.</p></div>
